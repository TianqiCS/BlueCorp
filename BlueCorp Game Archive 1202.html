&quot;Hey friendo!

Did you have fun on your vacation? The guy who was covering for you was so dull, didn&#39;t get any of my jokes at all. I think you are the only other person at BluCorp who knows the meaning of fun.

They swapped out some of the animals while you were gone. There are some nasty ones in this batch so be careful, we don&#39;t know everything about them yet.

I have at least figured out that Nematoda Animcomedenti really hate water. Not sure what it needs to drink yet though...you should probably try to figure that out as soon as possible so it makes it through the night.

The big one, Stomatopoda Terramillipedes, is really violent, I&#39;ve been sedating them every time I enter the room. That guy is going to be trouble, I know it.

The other guy is more subdued, I&#39;ve just been throwing the usual feed in and it seems okay for now...

My mom is coming into town next week, do you have any restaurant suggestions? I&#39;m thinking a nice Italian restaurant but I don&#39;t know any nearby. 

Catch you on the flip side!

PS - got you a little gift, it&#39;s in the drawer ;)

Rest in Peace, Piggy. 
He was the cubicle pet after Grouchy the Fish was removed by the cleaners, starting a minor war between us, which was then crushed by management who decided there would be no more fish. Probably for the best.
Piggy died when Day knocked him into his coffee. We haven&#39;t had the heart to throw him out yet.

Scientific classification name : Nematoda Animcomedenti, yet to receive family classification (NEMA)

Nematoda Animcomedenti is a land quadrupedalism found in tropical climates, in heavily forested areas. It is covered in a moist scale like skin that is a mix of browns and greens, giving it great camouflage in its natural habitat. Standing ¼ the size a human it is a fast moving pack hunter. Consisting of packs of 10-15 these creatures will surround and consume their prey in a matter of minutes, by latching themselves onto the prey. Using their 4 long, frog like appendages they will approach the prey quietly before jumping onto them. At this point they will stab the claw like appendages, underneath their bellies, into the prey to attach themselves. Pulling the Nematoda Animcomedenti off of the prey is nearly impossible if they reach this point as their claws are very strong and go very deep into the prey. The final step of the Nematoda Animcomedenti attachment to the prey is when they burrow their head into the prey’s tissue. At this point they begin to suck all the fluids from the host. Any harder structures are sprayed with a strong, acid like fluid from their mouths, that turns those structures into a soup for consumption by Nematoda Animcomedenti. 

These creatures will attack anything, interacting with them without sedation is highly discouraged.

Scientific classification name : Atolla Nonarma, from the Atollidae family. (NONA) 

Atolla Nonarma is a deep sea, octopus/jellyfish/spider crab like creature. It is difficult to find as it is mostly translucent in any light but in the dark it’s visible by its bioluminescence. It stands about 2 times the height of the average human, it is a slow moving, docile creature as meals on the seafloor are few and far between. It crawls the bottom of the ocean luring scavengers and other bottom feeders with its bioluminescence. The gentle/flowing movement of the extremities draw other animals in towards the center of Atolla Nonarma’s chest (which has the highest concentration of bioluminescence), where they enter through a hole into the hollow cavity. Once inside, similar to a Venus fly-trap, the entrance is sealed and digestive fluids are secreted and the unfortunate animals are then slowly digested. 

These creatures see to have hypnotic qualities, interacting with them without a tether is highly discouraged.

Scientific classification name : Stomatopoda Terramillipedes, from the Crustacea family. (STEPHEN)

This creature while colourful is one of the most violent BLU Crop has dealt with since it’s foundation. It’s large size and hard armoured exterior made is especially hard to sedate and capture. Keeping is constantly sedated for learning is required. It is a seemingly solitary species, living on the remote volcanic islands in the southern hemisphere. It is able to withstand extreme heat and pressures like the interior of active volcanoes. They stand around 8 times the size of the average human, they are extremely strong and agile and will eat anything that moves. It has multiple eyes and seems to see using heat signatures.  


Interacting with this creature is highly discouraged.

In front of me are two men in suits. One sits at the large desk table, smoking. The other, slowly pacing back and forth behind him.

The man at the desk says to me: 

&quot;Day sent me your report from last night. It seems that the Stoma is communicating in unexpected ways.&quot;

[[Yes! We need to gain more of his trust, he is not a normal creature.]]
[[Silence]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="54" name="Silence2" tags="" position="1997,243" size="100,100">&quot;So be it. How about you take the rest of the night off then?&quot;

&quot;Have a good night.&quot;

I felt the wet before I felt the pain. My entire body felt like it was forcing its way out of the small hole in my chest.
One breath...
Two...
Three

So I was fired then. 

I didn&#39;t even bother grabbing my things from the desk, I didn&#39;t want to be in the building a moment longer. Any longer and I would have - I don&#39;t even know what I would do...

I walked home, usually the buses have begun running but the time I get off, so that was my only option.

I was walking near the slightly wooded side of the BluCorp building when the hands grabbed me from behind.

I could taste the sweat of their hand against my mouth as I tried to scream; for help, for mercy.

I could feel the metal slide in and out, over and over and over. 

As fast as they grabbed me, they let go. I fell to the ground, and the world turned black around me.

No turning back now.

I ran to the Stoma&#39;s enclosure. They were throwing themselves against the walls, they were agitated by the deafening sound. 

There was no time to sedate. I could hear yelling approaching me.

And when I looked behind me

Stephen wasn’t there.
